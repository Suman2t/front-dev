        <h2 class="header">HOW TO MAKE <span class="momo">MOMO'S</span> THE NEPALI WAY</h2>
        <p>
            Namaste! There are three steps to making momo: you will first need to prepare fillings, then the wrappers, and finally you can cook them.
            <div>
                let's get started with our
                <strong class="strong">Ingredients:</strong>
            </div>
        </p>

        <div class="ingredients">
            <ul>
                <li>500 gm of minced meat</li>
                <li>1 grated onion</li>
                <li>Some finely chopped coriander</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of ginger and garlic paste each</li>
                <li>Half a tablespoon of coriander powder</li>
                <li>Half a tablespoon of turmeric</li>
                <li>Half a tablespoon of cumin powder</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of grated chilli</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of salt</li>
                <li>1 kg of flour</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s go on to the first step: preparing the fillings.</p>

        <div>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="sub-head">Preparing the fillings</span>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Add 1 grated onion to the minced meat.</li>
                        <li>Add half a tablespoon of turmeric powder. This is to add a bit of color to the meat.
                        </li>
                        <li>To enhance the flavor of the filling add 2 tablespoon of salt.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of grated chilli. You can add a bit more if you want the momos to be spicy.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of ginger and garlic paste each.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add half a tablespoon of coriander powder to make the filling taste a bit sour.
                        </li>
                        <li>Mix the spices with the meat.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and mix it again. The oil prevents the filling from getting too dry (Nepalese love momo with juicy fillings).
                        </li>
                        <li>Add finely chopped coriander.
                        </li>
                        <li>Mix them well.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now onto the wrappers.</p>
                </li>

                <li><span class="sub-head">Making the momo wrappers</span>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Put the flour into a bowl.</li>
                        <li>Add water a little at a time to the flour to make dough.</li>
                        <li>Knead the dough for a few more minutes. This makes the dough easier to use.</li>
                        <li>Pinch off a bit of the dough (the amount depends on how big you want the wrapping to be).</li>
                        <li>With a rolling pin roll the dough as thin as possible into circular shapes (don’t make them too thin or too thick) the size of a glass.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Tip: Roll a large amount of dough then use a glass to cut out smaller wrappers. Steel glasses are best for this.</p>
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li><span class="sub-head">Cooking the momos</span>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            Put around one tablespoon of the filling into the centre of the wrapping.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pinch one edge of the wrapping to the other edge then twist it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Keep doing this until the filling is covered (make sure the wrapping fully covers the filling otherwise the momos may break when steamed).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Oil the bottom of the steamer. This prevents the momos from sticking.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Put the momos in a systematic order so that they don’t touch each other.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Steam for 20 – 30 mins.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <p class="conc">After steaming, your momos are now ready to be served! Fresh momos taste the best, so have a few while you’re still waiting for others.</p>
